    A Star is a basic geometric shape that consists of a central point with multiple radiating arms or points. Stars are often used in various contexts, such as in art, design, and symbolism, to represent concepts like excellence, achievement, or celestial bodies.

    <img id="right" src="star html.jfif"  width="150" height="150" alt="star right">
    Stars can be depicted in different styles, ranging from simple five-pointed shapes to more complex designs with numerous points. They are commonly associated with the night sky, where they appear as bright, twinkling objects due to the light they emit or reflect.
